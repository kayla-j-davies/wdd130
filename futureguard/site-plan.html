        Are you looking for a school or extra mural for your child? Are you unsure how to choose which school or extra mural to send your child to? Many caregivers often struggle to find out which place or person will give the best education. This often results in students being placed in more than one school because they are moved when the education does not meet the standard it should. On Future Guard we hope to help you make that decision clearer and make it more effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        Future Guard will bring information to you from different studies on one platform. On this website we hope to reduce the stress of flipping through multiple websites to find helpful information. By bringing reviewed studies to you on various topics we will reduce the time it will take to review all the information that will help making these decisions clearer.

      <h3>Schools</h3>
      <h4>Facilities</h4>
      <p>
        Most people can agree that proper facilities greatly enhance the learning experience. Though it can be said that having all the best things does not necessarily mean that a learner will be a success, proper learning materials do greatly increase the success rate of learners. On August 26, 2019, Bruce Baker a Professor in the Graduate School of Education at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey wrote an article called “School Facilities Matter! In so many ways (how could they not?)”. In it he said that these are some of the things that increase student health. First high quality and safer play areas reduce student absence and lead to student retention. Second improved air and water quality contributes to better health. Third good lighting and classroom temperature regulation contribute positively to student mental and physical health and academic outcomes. Fourth newer mechanical systems are more efficient and lead to lower annual operating costs which can then be directed to classroom instruction. Lastly “adequate and physically appealing facilities improve teacher satisfaction and retention” which reduces “the need to counterbalance bad working conditions with higher wages”.

      <h4>Quality Teaching</h4>
      <p>
        No one can deny that a good teacher makes a world of difference. How do you know which schools have good teachers?  On 01 February 2012, Professor Jonah Rockoff, professor of Economics of the Columbia University in the City of New York wrote an article entitled “A Study on the Impact of Good Teachers Sparks National Attention”. He wrote the following “Teachers who succeed in raising standardized test scores have a lasting influence on their students’ lives, helping them avoid teenage pregnancy, go to college and earn more money as adults”. In his article he states that the main thing to look for is the overall classes scores to see if a teacher is a good teacher.

      </ul>
      <h3>Extra Murals</h3>
      <h4>Facilities</h4>
      <p>
        Most caregivers seek for more than just an academic education and seek the benefits that an extra mural can provide. Most sports are offered at many schools and there is often a lot of information that is given on the subject.  For sports facilities you want to look at the quality of the ground being played on, the pool being swam in, etc. and you want to see if the size of the needed facility is sufficient to train in. You should also check if the place or person you do this type of extra mural with has all the necessary to train your child. For those parents looking to have their child do arts and culture. Some of the things you should check is if the facility has the correct flooring for the type of dancing, or the correct instruments and other equipment for learning music, or the correct art supplies are being used to learn art, etc.
      </p>
      <h4>Teachers or Coaches</h4>
      <p>
        Physical activity can become dangerous if not done properly, this is very evident when doing a sport. That is why you want to find a coach who is recommended and knows what they are teaching very well. A teacher needs to know the correct technique to reduce the chance of injury. When looking for a teacher in the arts you need to see if the teacher has the correct technique and qualifications to teach their art. You should also look to see the well that teacher’s students do exams, concerts and competitions.
