    <p>Hi, I am from Joburg, South Africa. I am currently working as a music teacher. 
        I teach the piano and violin but I am studying towards a Bachlors degree in 
        Applied technology. 
    </p>
    <p>In my spare time I love to knit, craft and listen to and learn new music.
        I started playing in sacrament meetings this year and have completely enjoyed
        learning the hymns. The lyrics of each one have brought joy to my spirit.
    </p>
    <p>I recently discovered coding and programing because my dad has been studying
        it and it has caught my interest. I think it is amazing to see how each
        website, app, etc is created and I want to be able to have the tools 
        and knowledge to create some of that myself. That is what has brought me to
        study my chosen degree.
    </p>
    <p>I love learning new things and how to do one thing in different ways and
        from different viewpoints. I look forward to learning from this class this 
        semester.
    </p>
